Amazing job so far! Hopefully you are beginning to come up with ideas on how this all fits into your current project. Before we move into how GitHub Actions can be a Continuous Delivery (CD) solution, let's take those ideas and get the ball rolling on integrating them :smile:

## ðŸ’¬ Activity: Applying GitHub Actions to your project

_(~60 minutes)_

1. Allow us to take this time to work on a planning phase for implementing actions into your project.
1. We have more to come with actions, so if something doesn't quite fit at the moment, that's okay, we will have an opportunity to revisit this exercise later!
