We've done a whole lot of discussion about workflows, and how to consume actions within those workflows up to this point. Now we are going to shift gears and discuss how to create your own custom actions. We will show you how to write both JavaScript and Docker container actions in this segment of hands on activities.

We will wrap up this hands-on section by showing you how to use the GitHub Script action to write JavaScript directly in your workflows.
