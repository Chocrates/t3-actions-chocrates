## About GitHub Actions {docsify-ignore-all}

![actions-overview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/82087024-936a9b00-96ac-11ea-9379-099063e9b528.png)

GitHub Actions enable custom software development life cycles to be created alongside the existing source code in your GitHub repository.

GitHub Actions allow you to:

- Run a custom workflow triggered by ANY GitHub event
- Run simultaneous tests across multiple operating systems and runtimes
- Use GitHub-hosted runners for every major operating system or use self-hosted runners on premises or in the cloud
- Run workflows directly in a virtual machine
- Run workflows inside of containers
- Build applications in your language of choice with versatile language support
- View real time workflow logs and easily share CI/CD failures
- Architect container orchestration using docker-compose
- Automate workflows quickly using starter workflows
- Share and consume actions in the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)
- Get email notifications about workflow runs

## ðŸ’¬ Activity: Coletiv Case Study

_(~30 minutes)_

#### Coletiv: Their Story

In 2016, on a sunny land in the north of Portugal, Coletiv Studio was born. A Software Company with no more than four members and an ambitious vision, provided custom application development services that matched every clientâ€™s specific needs and goals.

Coletiv wanted to help companies of all shapes, sizes, and colors, to launch digital products that people would use and love. But for that, they needed to address many challenges - ranging from UX/UI to software development and cybersecurity.

After adding a few more team members to bring their total to approximately seven in-house developers, Coletiv decided it was time to extend their reach and soon partnered with Significa, a UX/UI design agency. Soon after these two partners would end up building Adamant, a cybersecurity company dedicated to fighting the hidden dangers of the internet.

#### Coletiv: ReactJS and GitHub Actions

Similar to many other software companies, Coeltiv implemented CI/CD as a standard step in their Q/A process. To evaluate the best tool for this process, Coletiv created a React.js project to use with GitHub Actions.

According to Coeltiv:

> A very common setup we use in our projects is to have a production and a staging environment, we mirror these environments with two branches:
>
> - **master** â€” contains the source for the production environment, containing the live system being used by the end users
> - **develop** â€” contains the source for the staging environment and is used internally to test new features before they end up in the hands of our users
>
> This means that every time there is a pull request into one of these branches, we run the continuous integration steps (e.g.: run unit and integration tests). If the steps donâ€™t report any error and other developers approve the code it is merged into the branch, triggering a deployment to the respective environment.

#### Accomplishing This With Actions

**Step 1: Initial Setup**

- Create a repository
- Ensure the repository has both `master` and `develop` branches

**Step 2: Setup a Continuous Integration Workflow**

- Add the following to `.github/workflows/cont-int.yml`

```yaml
name: Continuous Integration

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  buildAndTest:
    name: Build and Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: yarn

      - name: Build
        run: yarn build

      - name: Test
        run: yarn test --watchAll=false
```

One major advantage Coletiv found when using GitHub Actions is if any of the steps fail, the whole workflow fails and reports back to the pull request.

As a best practice, Coletiv established protections to prevent code from being merged until all checks successfully complete.

**Step 3: Setup Continuous Deployment Workflow**

> We decided to host our application on two distinct Amazon S3 buckets, one for each environment (staging & production).

```yaml
name: Continuous Deployment
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
      - develop

    jobs:
      deploy:
        name: Deploy
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      env:
        SOURCE_DIR: "build/"
        AWS_REGION: "us-east-1"
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.STAGING_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.STAGING_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}

      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v1

        - name: Install dependencies
          run: yarn

        - name: Build
          run: yarn build

        - name: Deploy staging
          if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
          uses: jakejarvis/s3-sync-action@v0.5.0
          with:
            args: --acl public-read --follow-symlinks --delete
          env:
            AWS_S3_BUCKET: ${{ secrets.STAGING_AWS_S3_BUCKET }}

        - name: Deploy production
          if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
          uses: jakejarvis/s3-sync-action@v0.5.0
          with:
            args: --acl public-read --follow-symlinks --delete
          env:
            AWS_S3_BUCKET: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_AWS_S3_BUCKET }}
```

#### Conclusion

Coletiv found that by having this workflow alongside their codebase prevented them from jumping between sites to detect CI/CD failures. This allowed them to better manage and maintain their quality standards.
