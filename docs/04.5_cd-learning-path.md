# Hands-on Activity üéâ {docsify-ignore-all}

![actions-learning-lab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/82087383-37544680-96ad-11ea-916a-2dba94bf52e3.png)

As we mentioned earlier, CD can come in two forms:

- Continuous Delivery
- Continuous Deployment

With Continuous Delivery being the precursor to Continuous Deployment. We find that because the association of these two concepts are incredibly similar, showing you examples of both is beneficial to your ability to fold actions into your projects.

In this hands-on section we will take a look at two different Learning Labs from our path.

The first course will guide us through **Continuous Delivery** by creating a deployable artifact in the form of a Docker üê≥ image. This image will be ready for deployment when your organization determines the time is right. We will store this image as a GitHub Package, rather than using the Docker Hub as a bonus integration piece üéâ!

Secondly, you will be guided through a **Continuous Delivery/Deployment** example to a cloud platform that best serves your organization. The result will be a publicly available deployment of the Tic-Tac-Toe application used in the CI course.

- Azure

With more cloud options coming in the future
