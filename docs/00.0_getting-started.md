GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows. GitHub Actions enables you to:

- Build, test, and deploy your code with world class CI/CD right from GitHub.
- Make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want through community and custom shareable components.

Over the next few days, you will learn everything you'll need to know to begin using GitHub Actions to its full potential. **We will end by migrating one of your existing projects to GitHub Actions.**

**Questions**:

1. What is your role?
1. What do you already know about using GitHub Actions?
1. What would you like to learn?
