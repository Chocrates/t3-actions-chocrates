## GitHub teams write their own actions {docsify-ignore-all}

At GitHub, our teams have very unique needs and this often leads to them writing custom actions that solve their unique problems. We will take a few minutes to look at some of the solutions teams at GitHub have come up with.

### Professional services case study

<img src="images/automate-your-workflow.png" alt="automate your workflow" height=100 width=100 style="float:left; margin: -4px 10px;">

Our Professional Services team is comprised of many other smaller teams. One such team is the Programs team. They are responsible for building the programs our customers need. This ranges from creating scripts and small applications to creating presentations and training materials. They are the team behind the content placed in front of you today!

**Overview**

To develop these programs and turn them into GitHub products, the Professional Services team created a productizing process. This process was a guideline to help get a solution from idea to customer and involved six major steps. Each step contained a series of smaller tasks within it, and these tasks were what decided if a step was complete or not.

The workflow for productization of an offering was a manual process. Each time an offering was in development the team would first open a **proposal issue** outlining the reasons behind the offering.

Once the offering received the green light for development, the person in the driver seat for this offering would then open a **pull request** that "moved" the offering into the first major step in becoming a product.

Work on that offering would take place in that **pull request**. When the major step was completed the owner would come through and **manually merge** the pull request.

At the same time, a new **pull request** would be **manually** created to move the offering into the next major step.

This process would repeat itself until the project was complete.

**The problems**

- Tedious process requiring too much manual intervention.
- Repetitive steps to move the offering down the development chain.
- Hard for other teams to follow where in the development process on offering currently was.

**The solution... a custom productization action**

GitHub offers quite a [robust API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) for repository integration and the team knew they could leverage it along with action to automate this process.

Since GitHub also publishes a nice library called [Octokit](https://developer.github.com/v3/libraries/) the team decided to create a JavaScript based action to solve their automation needs.

By using Octokit along with GitHub Actions the team could listen for events and respond to them accordingly. The final solution is not fully automatic, but it did reduce the number of necessary manual steps at hand while allowing the team to have manual intervention where they thought they needed it the most.

The new process is as follows:

- Manually open proposal issue, this issue stays open throughout development and now becomes the source of truth for the entire process.
- Label the issue with the name of the desired step in the process.
- When label is added, a GitHub Actions workflow runs that creates a branch and opens a pull request containing the steps of this stage in the process as the body of the pull request.
- After the pull request is opened, a GitHub Actions workflow assigns the pull request to the owner of the offering and comments in the tracking issue with a link to the pull request.
- When the owner is ready to move to the next step, they manually merge the pull request and manually apply another label to the proposal issue.

**Advantages of this solution**

The team is still responsible for merging or closing pull requests, this helps maintain the history of who is doing what to the offering as it is being developed. Even with a few manual steps in place, the amount of manual intervention has been reduced significantly.

Employees outside of the team can quickly glance at the issue and see the labels applied to it, giving them quick vision on where that offering is in the productization process. (The screenshot below shows that this issue belongs to an offering and that is has been through or is currently in an associated phase.)

Anyone who reads into the issue will easily be able to find all associated pull requests with the work being done, both past and present, allowing for easier tracking and collaboration from others!

**File layout for this solution**

- Files located in `.github/actions/productizer`

  - `action.yml` containing a single input which is an access token that actions will use to interact with the GitHub API.

  ```yaml
  name: offering productizer
  description: This Action helps the Services-Programs team automate the productization of an offering
  author: "mattdavis0351"

  inputs:
  GITHUB_TOKEN:
    description: Token scoped with the ability to manipulate issues and pull requests, recommended to use secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN
    required: true

  runs:
  using: "node12"
  main: dist/index.js

  branding:
  icon: coffee
  color: orange
  ```

  - JavaScript files that utilize Octokit to communicate with the API

  ```javascript
  const core = require("@actions/core");
  const github = require("@actions/github");
  const phase = require("./highestPhase");
  const branches = require("./createBranch");
  const message = require("./messages");
  const fs = require("fs");

  async function run() {
    try {
      const token = core.getInput("GITHUB_TOKEN");
      const octokit = new github.GitHub(token);
      const context = github.context;

      // list the labels on the issue that triggered the workflow
      // destructure the data field into an array of labels referenced as a var of 'labels'
      console.log("getting label array length...");
      const labels = context.payload.issue.labels;
      console.log(`This issue has ${labels.length} labels`);

      // Verify that the labels array has more than one object in it
      // this accounts for the 'O: offering' label
      if (labels.length > 1) {
        // check if is a productizing issue
        const isProductizing = context.payload.issue.title.split(" ");
        if (
          isProductizing.includes("Programs:") &&
          isProductizing.includes("Productizing")
        ) {
          // Get issue title and trim the issue templating off so only the
          // product name remains with no extra whitespace
          console.log("trimming title");
          const trimmedTitle = context.payload.issue.title
            .replace("Programs: Productizing ", "")
            .trim();

          // replace spaces in the trimmedTitle name with dashes
          // This allows for branches to be created easier later on
          console.log("adding dashes...");
          const productTitle = trimmedTitle.split(" ").join("-").toLowerCase();

          // Get the current phase the offering is attempting to move into
          // This is based on the labels array and compared to the stock array
          // found inside of highestPhase.js named 'phaseLabel' if there is no match
          // highestPhase() returns undefined
          // Once found make sure it's lower case
          console.log("finding current phase and converting to lower case"); //move inside of if statement at this point
          const currentPhase = phase.highestPhase(labels);
          const trimmedPhase = currentPhase.replace("P:", "").trim();

          // if currentPhaseLower is not undefined AND the issue has more than one label to account
          // for the 'O: offering' label, create a new branch and open a pull for collaboration
          // on the product as it moves to the new phase.
          // else write log message about why this was skipped and return 0
          if (!currentPhase) {
            console.log(message.NO_EFFECT);
            return;
          }
          const currentPhaseLower = trimmedPhase.toLowerCase();
          // Craft product title and phase into one srting to use for branches and pulls
          const productTitleAndPhase = `${productTitle}-${currentPhaseLower}`;

          // get the branches for the current repo and destructure the body of the response
          // to an array called getHeads to be passed into createBranch() later
          console.log("getting refs with octokit");
          const { data: getHeads } = await octokit.git.listRefs({
            owner: context.repo.owner,
            repo: context.repo.repo,
          });

          // Code truncated for readability... it's really just more of this octokit stuff anyway ðŸ˜„
        } else {
          console.log(message.NOT_TEMPLATE);
          return;
        }
      } else {
        console.log(message.NOT_APPLY);

        return;
      }
    } catch (error) {
      core.info(error);
