[PunchCode](https://punchcode.org) is an in person web development bootcamp that focuses on turning every day people in to new entry level developers over the course of 12 weeks. The individuals that attend this bootcamp come from all walks of life and have a wide array of experience with a computer.

### PunchCode case study

Not only do these students lack the knowledge to write code, the workflow portion of software development is also highly foreign to them. Source code management, pull requests and code reviews are all things they have never heard of prior to stepping foot into PunchCode.

**Overview**

While the primary focus at PunchCode is to teach people how to write HTML, CSS, JS and SQL there is a secondary focus on teaching them how to write code as a team. Early in the program student's spend a majority of their time writing code within a repo of their own, often times committing code directly to their `master` branch. As they progress through the course they find themselves beginning to collaborate more and more with their peers. Soon, they are opening pull requests in a shared repository to accomplish their project tasks and they begin to adopt a more real world workflow.

**The problem**

As teams adopt a collaborative workflow pull requests often get forgotten about as new features are being developed under tight timelines. A problem that is definitely not unique to a new developer!

PunchCode students were finding that they weren't getting code reviews in a timely manner for one reason or another. If someone was requested for review it was taking them too long to address the pull request. Sometimes days to weeks would go by before a review came in, often making the pull request obsolete before the code was able to be merged.

**The solution... a custom notification action**

A few students got frustrated at this process and started looking at the other tools they used to communicate. This observation led them to realize that all PunchCode students used [Slack](https://slack.com) to communicate. Not only that, but Slack activity was much greater than any activity they were seeing in repository issues and pull requests. This moved their decision forward to create an action that would use Slack to remind them that they've been requested for review on a pull request!

Creating an action has been made accessible to even the newest of developers, and with that they began integrating Slack to GitHub!

The team followed this process to get their integration up and running:

- Create a new Slack app with Node.js software development kit (SDK).
- This bot will need access to the `chat:write` permission found under the `OAuth & Permissions` tab.
- Install the app to your Slack workspace. Take note of the `Bot User OAuth Access Token`.
- Invite your new bot to your desired channel via Slack slash command. From your desired channel enter `/invite @<YOUR BOT NAME>`. It should pop up automatically.
- From your the repo settings create a new secret for the bot access token. To use the workflow example below, name this secret `slackbot_token`. However you can name this anything you like.

The actions metadata took a few inputs which the team process in the actions source code:

`action.yml`

```yaml
name: "github pull request reminder"

inputs:
  active:
    description: Determines whether the action will run.
    required: false
    default: true
  channel:
    description: The channel you want messages posted to
    required: false
    default: \#general
  slack-auth:
    description: The OAuth token of the slack bot, stored as repo secret
    required: true
    default: "you didn't supply a token"
  repo-token:
    description: this is an authentication token
    required: true
    default: no token

runs:
  using: "node12"
  main: "dist/index.js"
```

`index.js`

```javascript
const core = require("@actions/core");
const github = require("@actions/github");
const { WebClient } = require("@slack/web-api");

const run = async () => {
  try {
    const active = core.getInput("active");
    if (!active) return;

    const repo_token = core.getInput("repo-token");
    const octokit = new github.GitHub(repo_token);

    const slack_token = core.getInput("slack-auth");
    const web = new WebClient(slack_token);

    const channel_name = core.getInput("channel");

    const { data } = await octokit.pulls.list({
      repo: github.context.repo.repo,
      owner: github.context.repo.owner,
    });

    if (!data) return;

    const reviewers = {};

    data.forEach((pr) => {
      pr.requested_reviewers.map((reviewer) => {
        if (!reviewers[reviewer.login]) {
          reviewers[reviewer.login] = {
            login: reviewer.login,
            urls: [pr.html_url],
            repo: pr.head.repo.html_url,
          };
        } else {
          reviewers[reviewer.login].urls.push(pr.html_url);
        }
      });
    });

    const promises = Object.values(reviewers).map((reviewer) => {
      const url_text = reviewer.urls
        .map((url, idx) => {
          return `\n - PR ${+idx + 1}: <${url}| ${url
            .split("/")
            .splice(-2, 2)
            .join(" ")}>`;
        })
        .join();
      return web.chat.postMessage({
        type: "mrkdwn",
        text: `Hey ${reviewer.login}! Your review has been requested for repo <${reviewer.repo}| ${github.context.repo.repo}> on these pull requests, ${url_text}`,
        channel: channel_name,
      });
    });

    Promise.all(promises).catch((error) => {
      console.log("error", error);
    });
  } catch (error) {
    core.setFailed(error.message);
  }
};

run();
```

The team recommended to use this action on a schedule so that they were regularly reminded in Slack to go submit their reviews. To accomplish this they needed to simply setup a workflow file like this:

```yaml
name: My Workflow

on:
  # configure triggers
  schedule:
    # triggers the action every 5 minutes!!
    - cron: "*/5 * * * *"

jobs:
  action:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: My Action Name

        uses: nsoto92/Hackathon-ActionBot@master
        with:
          # The name of your slack channel the bot was invited to
          channel: my_slack_channel_name
          # this is automatically generated by Github
          repo-token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
          # this is the name you gave to the secret in your Github repo
          slack-auth: ${{secrets.slackbot_token}}
          # this is the on/off switch
          active: true
```

**Advantages of this solution**

- This action can be incorporated in any workflow and can run based on any event that triggers a workflow... not just cron.
- Being a public action, any GitHub user can consume this in their workflows even though it isn't officially published to the marketplace
- The action is simple to interact with

**Challenges the team faced**

Their action does not `@mention` the Slack user, it simply prints their name to the channel and links them to pull requests that are waiting on them. The team found this to be an uphill battle for them since their Slack usernames weren't always identical to their GitHub handles. This made `@mentions` unpredictable.

Most members on the team had less than 8 weeks of coding experience when this action was written, and half of that time was spent learning front-end technologies like HTML and CSS. Using an external SDK like Slack's and learning from the technical documentation was their biggest hurdle.
